Description This session covers the essential of data management for a project on NeSI. It starts with a bit of general thinking before moving into some NeSI specifics.
Good habits Always have your data in at least two places. Never edit your raw data. Use informative file names: filtered_data.txtis meaningless on its own. data_noMISSINGDATAremoved12lowqual.csv is much better. Avoid proprietary formats Have a readme file Your methods are easily transportable, and should bring anyone from raw data to results.</description></item><item><title>Text Editor Hacks</title><link>https://otagomohio.github.io/hacky2021/sessions/0810_vscode_tricks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://otagomohio.github.io/hacky2021/sessions/0810_vscode_tricks/</guid><description>Presented by Hugh Cross
Getting more out of your text editor This session will highlight a couple of ways to utilise your text editor in ways you may not have thought possible. We will use the popular text editor Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for this session, but the tools we show you today are available in some fashion on other text editors, including Sublime Text and Atom.
Installing VS Code Extensions When you open Visual Studio Code there are several tabs on the side that will expand to show different options.</description></item><item><title>Snakemake Tutorial</title><link>https://otagomohio.github.io/hacky2021/sessions/0907_snakemake/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://otagomohio.github.io/hacky2021/sessions/0907_snakemake/</guid><description>Written and presented by Julie Blommaert
What the heck is a snakemake? Is it a snake that likes to make cake? It&amp;rsquo;s a workflow manager: What is a workflow manager? Examples of workflow graphs produced by Snakemake:
But what&amp;rsquo;s in it for me? Reproducibility Not just good for science, but good for future you Record keeping Easy to share Adaptability How does it work then? Each step is called a &amp;ldquo;rule&amp;rdquo; Each rule is defined by input and output files, and a task Snakemake can then figure out how the tasks are connected and if any files are missing or have been updated Snakemake builds on Python syntax, but you can use other languages within it (e.</description></item><item><title>Intro to Jupyter R on NeSI</title><link>https://otagomohio.github.io/hacky2021/sessions/0921_ronnesi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://otagomohio.github.io/hacky2021/sessions/0921_ronnesi/</guid><description>Written and presented by Ludovic Dutoit
install a package in R on Jupyter To run this example, you will need to log on to JupyterHub, and launch an R notebook:
try loading an uninstalled library from a Jupyter R 4.0.1 notebook
It is worth trying first because a lot of things are pre-installed:

Searching for genes on NCBI webpage This week we are going to go over some of the ways that you can access data on the NCBI webpage. One of the most common types of search on NCBI is Nucleotide. Go to the NCBI webpage and select Nucleotide from the drop down menu. Then we will enter the search terms cytochrome oxidase gene and the organism Insecta.</description></item><item><title>Loops</title><link>https://otagomohio.github.io/hacky2021/sessions/1019_forloops/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://otagomohio.github.io/hacky2021/sessions/1019_forloops/</guid><description>Written and Presented by Ludovic Dutoit
Loops are awesome at doing what computers do best, repeating an exact task many times without errors. They are commonly used to repeat a task over a list of files, or numbers, or anything you can think of.
The Bash loop The basic structure of a loop is as follows:
for &amp;lt;variable name&amp;gt; in &amp;lt;a list of items&amp;gt; do &amp;lt;some command&amp;gt; $&amp;lt;variable name&amp;gt; done The variable name will be the variable you specify in the do section and will contain the item in the loop that you&amp;rsquo;re on.</description></item></channel></rss>
