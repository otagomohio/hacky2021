Description This session covers the essential of data management for a project on NeSI. It starts with a bit of general thinking before moving into some NeSI specifics.
Good habits Always have your data in at least two places. Never edit your raw data. Use informative file names: filtered_data.txtis meaningless on its own. data_noMISSINGDATAremoved12lowqual.csv is much better. Avoid proprietary formats Have a readme file Your methods are easily transportable, and should bring anyone from raw data to results.</description></item><item><title>Text Editor Hacks</title><link>https://otagomohio.github.io/hacky2021/sessions/0810_vscode_tricks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://otagomohio.github.io/hacky2021/sessions/0810_vscode_tricks/</guid><description>Presented by Hugh Cross
Getting more out of your text editor This session will highlight a couple of ways to utilise your text editor in ways you may not have thought possible. We will use the popular text editor Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for this session, but the tools we show you today are available in some fashion on other text editors, including Sublime Text and Atom.
Installing VS Code Extensions When you open Visual Studio Code there are several tabs on the side that will expand to show different options.</description></item></channel></rss>
