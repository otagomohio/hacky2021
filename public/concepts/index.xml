      <description>Most bioinformatic methods can be organised into a few basic concepts. I have organised these in terms of how the method influences the sequence files and how it modifies or what information is gathered from them. I use the term &amp;lsquo;sequence file&amp;rsquo; very broadly; it can encompass anything from raw reads to assembled contigs to scaffolds to whole organelle or chromosome assemblies. I have furthur divided these into two main classes: lower-level processes and higher-level processes.</description>
